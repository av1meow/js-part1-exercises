## Answer's

* Version control is a system for tracking changes in your computer files and coordinating work on files among multiple people.

  It is a primarily used for source code management in software development. It keeps track of changes in any set of files.

* Branch allows you to creat variations of your code, represents an independent line of development.

  You use branches cause they serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics

* Commit gets all your code you wrote and saves it to your repository.

  You're commit messages can really help you when you finish a section in your project so you can go and look back or change anything.

* A merge conflict can occur when merging or pulling to your branch. When you have one it comes up as **CONFLICT**.
